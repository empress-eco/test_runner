## About The Project

### Overview
test_runner is a robust extension designed to optimize the testing process for developers. It allows you to run tests from an app using a single command or keybind, providing a more streamlined and simplified testing approach.

### Key Features
- Run all tests in an open file
- Run the test nearest to the cursor in an open file

These features aim to reduce the time spent on testing and increase productivity.

### Built With
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Configure `test_runner.siteName` in settings.

### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/empress-eco/test_runner.git
```
To get started, simply run the nearest or run all commands.

```

## Usage
